# Research Software Engineer Stories

> Hi friends! üëãÔ∏è We've moved over to the [Developer Stories podcast](https://rseng.github.io/devstories/) podcast - the same passion and fun as before, but aiming to be more inclusive! See you there!

This is a repository that serves research software engineer stories audio files
in anticipation of when the primary repository [RSE Stories](https://github.com/USRSE/rse-stories)
reaches it's size limit. The episodes here will be organized by folders named
by the year, and named in the same format as the [RSE Stories episodes](https://github.com/USRSE/rse-stories/tree/master/assets/episodes).
